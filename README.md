# Excimontec_Analysis

This is an Igor Pro procedures package for loading, analyzing, and plotting data generated by the [Excimontec](https://github.com/MikeHeiber/Excimontec) simulation tool. 
Excimontec is an open-source KMC simulation software package for modeling organic semiconductor materials and devices, such as OPVs, OLEDs, and more.

#### Current Major Features:

- Import Excimontec job data folders from Time of Flight Tests, IQE Tests, and Dynamics Tests, into an organized folder structure in Igor
- Plot time of flight current density and average normalized energy transients, transit time distributions, and charge extraction map
- Plot dynamics test concentration and energy transients
- Plot IQE test charge extraction maps

### Installation Instructions:

If you place the Excimontec_Analysis folder into the Igor Procedures folder, the Excimontec submenu will appear in the toolbar when you start Igor Pro.
